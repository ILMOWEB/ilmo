University of Helsinki, Software Production Project, Fall 2023.

The project implemented a new enrollment system for physical chemistry lab work at the University of Helsinki. The web application provides students a platform to register for different laboratory assignments and return reports related to the assignments. The application offers the possibility for the teacher to create new lab assignments for a course and multiple exercise groups for the lab assignments. The teacher and assistants are able to review the reports sent by the students.
